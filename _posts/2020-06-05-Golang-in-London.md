title: Golang in London
---

I've been awfully quiet this week here, for a good reason. To cut straight to the chase - join me on the next [Golang in London](https://www.meetup.com/Golang-London/) meetup where we'll create a small application for playing your favourite songs through terminal - entirely from scratch!

No previous Go knowledge needed, we will work it out!
