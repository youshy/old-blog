title: Golang In London - It's Today!
---

A lot of things happening in my life now - will get you all up to speed one day! But today - if you still don't know what are your plans for this evening - join me at [Golang in London](https://www.meetup.com/Golang-London/events/271102633) meetup and let's write some fun code!

If you know that you won't be able to attend, fear not! I've prepared the whole workshop in a form of a GitHub repo you can follow and recreate everything that we'll code! Check it [here](https://github.com/youshy/Golang-In-London-Music-Player)!
