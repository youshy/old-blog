title: I have released an album!
---

Today is a very good day - after a loooo(...)oong time of not releasing any new music, I've released an album!

10 songs, all sung in Polish, all in indie-rap genre, first one I have ever produced with my good frieds - everything from music to vocals! We have amazing guests on the album, from legends of Polish alternative to long-time rap kings; mixed by Webber (which is, by the way, one of my childhood dreams to have my music mixed by this guy) and mastered by Eprom.

Check it out on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6PAuKB5Xz9nocMyxvGX2YP?si=upaptw2DToC67A1X7_5f3Q) or on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8vFvHFYe2w224V0lPd2QH7VKmusfa6oE). DEFINITELY let me know what you think!

> Hopefully this is not the only one I'll release this year - a LOT of the things in the making!
