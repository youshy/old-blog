title: Learn something about Go - DevOps Playground
---

Today's a quick one - my amazing company [ECS Digital](https://ecs.co.uk/digital-engineering/) has a small subset of people who runs [DevOps Playground](https://www.meetup.com/DevOpsPlayground/).

What's DevOps Playground? It's a meetup for devops-oriented techies who wants to learn something new about their profession. This time, I'm more than proud to run the next one on May 28th and teach you all something about writing full CRUD (Create-Read-Upload-Delete) RESTful API in Go!

I'll walk you through all the techniques I use to create APIs and we'll make everything nice and deployable!

Hope to see you all there - [sign up HERE](https://www.meetup.com/DevOpsPlayground/events/270672982/)
