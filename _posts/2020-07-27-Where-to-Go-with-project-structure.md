title: Where to Go with project structure
---

Have you ever asked yourself any of the questions below:

## HOW SHOULD I START MY NEW GO PROJECT? WILL THIS IMPACT MY LIFE? SHOULD I GO GET PIZZA TODAY? SHOULD I GO GET PIZZA TOMORROW?

Let's go with the answers we know first:

* **SHOULD I GO GET PIZZA TODAY?** - Yes
* **SHOULD I GO GET PIZZA TOMORROW?** - Yes

> Why are you even wondering about that... Pizza never wonders about you, it just wraps you in the cheesy love and (okay, I'll stop there)

## How about that Go project then?

I will answer this question **THIS WEDNESDAY** (which is July 29th 2020) over at **[Golang in London](https://www.meetup.com/Golang-London/)** event! If you haven't figured out your Wednesday yet, go [HERE](https://www.meetup.com/Golang-London/events/271750934/) and secure your spot!

## Will this impact Your life?

Well, definitely. We'll talk about Go. We'll talk about projects. We'll talk about big dogs in the Go game. And, most definitely, we'll talk about the pizza. Even about the pineapple/olives combo.

See you then!
